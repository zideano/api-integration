# java-api-integration
Create a RESTFul Java implementation for a billing integration interface, which separates the billing logic for different Android APP Stores: Google Play, Apple Store etc. 

The billing integration interface implementation will nicely separate the billing logic from the developer's code. 
Our implementation will connect to the Flexion platform, providing these three RESTFul Web Services functionalities:

1. Buy
2. Consume
3. Get purchases

The REST API is provided as a sandbox from Flexion.

# flexion-java
Create a java RESTFul implementation of an integration interface, which separates billing logic for different APP Stores: 
Google Play, Apple Store etc. 

This billing integration interface implementation will nicely separate the billing logic from the developer's code. 
Our implementation will connect to the Flexion platform, provides the three RESTFul Web Services functionalities:

1. Buy
2. Consume
3. Get purchases

The REST API is provided as a sandbox from Flexion.
